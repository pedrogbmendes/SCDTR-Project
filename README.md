# Real-Time Cooperative Decentralized Control of a Smart Office Illumination System

DISTRIBUTED REAL-TIME CONTROL SYSTEMS - Project


Abstractâ€”In order to control of an efficient way, the illumination of an office, an autonomous and cooperative real-time illumination system is created. A simple, smaller and cheaper version is implemented using 2 luminaires each of them composed by a LED, a sensor (LDR) and a unit (using an Arduino) to read data from the sensor, to process it and to control the LED according to the sensor data. Since it can be several luminaires, each of them with a controller is necessary to implement a distributed system where all nodes work together to achieve a common goal of minimizing the energy consumption but restricted to the occupancy state and the minimum requirements of each node that have to be satisfied. The nodes in a distributed system need to communicate between them so a protocol of communications has to be implemented in order to exchange data between luminaires and this data could be correctly recognized.

The performance of the system is evaluated using the simulated office in order to validate this implementation. The solution proposed is tested not only with sources with same characteristics but also with different to prove the robustness and capability to minimize the energy.
